Main Goals:


    Begin working on final internship paper and PowerPoint presentation
    Finalize CSV converter and finish debugging scripts
    Analyze and visualize energy, CPU, memory statistics



Tasks Completed:


    ✅ Finished debugging and finalized the TensorBoard to CSV converter
    ✅ Visualized resource stats: energy, CPU, memory using .ipynb
    ✅ Observed that energy values were identical under one scheduler
    ✅ Commented out FairShare in notebook to isolate WaggleScheduler logs
    ✅ Manually compared scheduler outputs by changing file names
    ✅ Collected workload data:
        Number of running vs finished workloads
        Compared stats from running simulation with 2 nodes vs 6 nodes

    ✅ Investigated whether performance improved with Jetson vs RPi, or 3+3 distribution
    ✅ Finalized all scheduler module logic and visualizations
