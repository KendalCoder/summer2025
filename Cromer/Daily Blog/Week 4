Weekly Log: Scheduler Integration and Optimization (Week of June 24)


Weekly deliverables

Task 1:
Run and test simulation using Quick Start instructions

Task 2-1:
 Uncomment scheduler in mywaggle.yaml

Task 2-2:
 Fix bug in FairshareScheduler and demonstrate it running in simulation

Task 3:
 Integrate Henry’s dual descent scheduler from Colab link into the scheduler/ directory and run it with simulation



Monday

• Met with Yongho → Received this week’s deliverables

• Completed:
• Passport Safety Training
• Section 101 Security Training
• Additional safety module
• Started:

• Task 1: README.md Quick Start
• Ran, tested, and debugged simulation code
• Investigated bug in FairshareScheduler



Tuesday

• Worked on research journal: methodology & design notes
Focused on:

• Fixing Fairshare bug:
error line 10 

# Old (error)
cpu_usage = [node.metrics["cpu"] for node in nodes]

# Fixed:
cpu_usage = [node.metrics.get("cpu", float(”inf”)) for node in nodes]


Had to fix errors to make code run :
• Installed missing packages (tensorboard)
eea971c8f87b5cf2e53c94398ccd6f773a16adfe
0080f1099258f363167f8bdc8ded18c1defcdcaf

• Used --config flag to avoid manually selecting the YAML file every run:

--config /home/kendal/edge_resource_analysis/simulation/kubernetes/mywaggle.yaml


Completed Task 2-2 → Working demonstration of FairshareScheduler with debugged logic




Wednesday

• Moved Henry’s dual descent code into the scheduler/ directory (dual_node.py)

• Installed cvxpy:

Bash: pip install cvxpy

• Fixed henry code for the dualnode.py :
 46b2a7c7a65af8114c42dca50a599d0c06d85433

• Learned:

• cvxpy enables mathematical optimization in Python using variables, objectives, constraints

• Attended a seminar (HPC focus)

• Wrote prep notes for Thursday code explanation for the meeting



Thursday

• Morning: Met with mentor to review simulation logic and scheduler goals

• Afternoon: Met with team

• Reached out to Work with Henry to:

• Clarify lambda format

• Continue testing dual descent scheduler

• Make centralized_solver.py runnable with simulation

• Understand and get clarification on the output of the code match his that he ran and mine




Friday

• Completed Task 3: Integrated and ran Henry’s scheduler in the simulation

• Verified: It integrates with run.py
• CVXPY logic solves the problem and dual update works
• Reviewed SAGE documentation for formatting results:

• Started working on next steps for my journal
